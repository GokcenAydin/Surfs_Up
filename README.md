## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of the analysis was to retrieve weather information for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to ensure 
the year-round weather-wise sustainability of a surf and ice cream business to be opened in the city. The data gave us a summary of
different statistics for the amount of precipitation during the year. 

## Results 

- Count results, which show the number of times precipitation was observed in the area, showed that there was more precipitation
in June than in December.
- The results of the statistical analysis, which showed the mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25%, 50%, 75% and maximum statistics, showed the 
precipitation amounts for each station for each day. According to the summary of daily mean precipitation amounts, the numbers were 74.944118
for June, and 71.041529 for December, which was higher for June.
- While the values of June showed 64.000000 as a minimum, and 85.000000 as a maximum number of precipitation; December values were 56.000000 for minimum,
and 83.000000 for maximum, which proves that both values in summary of December were lower than they were in summary of June.

## Summary
According to the results, June had higher number of precipitation than December as was shown in count values, which was also reflected in the statistical 
analysis results, proving that the average amount, and minimum and maximum amounts were also higher in June. Standard deviations were retrieved as 3.257417 
in June, and 3.745920 in December, both of which could be considered as low, as data were clustered around mean. 

In order to support the analysis summary with more useful information, retrieving the data of density of the precipitations on a daily-basis percentage, 
and retrieving the counts of durations of the precipitations would be a useful contribution for the risk evaluation for the possible business enterprise.
